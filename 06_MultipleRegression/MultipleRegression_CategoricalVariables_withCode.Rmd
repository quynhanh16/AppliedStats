This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

-   The equation of the model is $y=-22.59+2.04x_1+3.01x_3$. Here $y$ is the log of the ratio of brain tumor concentration and liver tumor concentration, $x_1$ is the number of days post inoculation, and $x_3$ is the sex (0 as F and 1 as M).

-   Interpretation: a unit increase in the number of days post inoculation ($x_1$) with the other predictor (sex) held constant will produce an increase of 2.03 in the log ratio of brain tumor concentration and liver tumor concentration. The effect is significant with p-value as 0.003.

-   Interpretation: Given other predictor (number of days post inoculation) held constant, a male rat will have an increase of 3.01 in the log ratio of brain tumor concentration and liver tumor concentration as compared to a female rat. The effect is significant with p-value as $9.51 \times 10^{-5}$.

-   The F test shown here is to take if any of the predictors are useful in predicting the response.

    -   $H_0$: $\beta_1=\beta_3=0$. This is equivalent to the null model ($y=\beta_0$).
    -   F statistics is 14.8 with DF as 2 (p-1) and 31 (n-p)
    -   p value is $3.07 \times 10^{-5}$
    -   Thus, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that some of the predictors are useful.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
