This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
ANOVAdata=read.csv("ANOVAData.csv")
tool=factor(ANOVAdata$tool)#alerting R that "tool" is a factor
time=factor(ANOVAdata$time) #alerting R that "time" is a factor
table(tool,time)#the model is balanced

```

```{r}
interaction.plot(tool,time,ANOVAdata$diam) #gives the plot of means 
interaction.plot(time,tool,ANOVAdata$diam) #gives the plot of means 

```

```{r}
tool_time=aov(ANOVAdata$diam~tool+time+tool*time)#analyis of variance
summary(tool_time)
```

```{r}
TukeyHSD(tool_time,"tool") #multiple comparisons btwn the tool levels
plot(TukeyHSD(tool_time, "tool", conf.level=.95), las=1)
```

```{r}
TukeyHSD(tool_time,"time") #multiple comparisons btwn the time levels

plot(TukeyHSD(tool_time, "time", conf.level=.95), las=1)
```

```{r}
TukeyHSD(tool_time,"tool:time") #multiple comparisons for interaction 
plot(TukeyHSD(tool_time, "tool:time", conf.level=.95), las=1)
```

```{r}
lm_model=lm(ANOVAdata$diam~tool:time-1)
summary(lm_model)
```

```{r}
plot(lm_model)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
